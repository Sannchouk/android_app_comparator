## To-Do Lists

### Tree Structure
- [x] Define tree structure
- [x] Parse the apk architecture
- [] Use complex nodes to represent files

### Bipartite Graph
- [x] Define bipartite graph
- [x] Implement bipartite graph usage
- [x] Transform tree to graph

### Tokens
- [x] Implement tokenization process
- [x] Define a first approach to tokenize tokens (path)
- [] Define a more robust approach to tokenize

### Metropolis
- [x] Define methods to run the algorithm
- [x] Have functional algorithm (choice : remove conencted edges also remove the edge)

### Optimization
- [] Use &str instead of String  in nodes
- [] Use ids instead of objects

### Final
- [] The whole process gives coherent results
